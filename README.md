## Configure Running Environment
This section introduces how to set up the environment to run NeRC from scratch, step by step. We also provide an environment file for rapid configuration. However, it would be better to follow the guides to set up your own environment.

## Inference

## NeRC on the Edge
This section presents how to deploy NeRC on edge servers.

## GnssQuest App on Android
This section introduces our developed GnssQuest app that can communicate with edge servers that run NeRC.
